# Angular2-ZM

## Description
Create a basic Read-only site that will fetch static data from the server and display it on the site. 
The theme for the site is a restaurant.

## Structure
The site should have 3 pages:
- A landing page
- A browsing page to view a list of items (3 items is fine)
- A detail page to view specific items (3-4 details about each item)

## Styling
There is no need for a lot of CSS, the site only needs to be presentable. Basic bootstrap styling is more than enough.

## Data
The data must be retrieved from the server, it should not be hardcoded into the design.
The data can be stored in static JSON files or in any way that you desire. 

## Hosting
You can choose any basic free hosting to make this project live for a few hours while it is reviewed.
